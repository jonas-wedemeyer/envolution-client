## Getting started

This is the front-end repository. The back-end can be found at : https://github.com/jonas-wedemeyer/envolution-server

### Installation

1. Begin by forking this repository, and cloning to your computer. 

 ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jonas-wedemeyer/envolution-client
 ```
   
2.  Install the necessary dependencies. Navigate to the `client` folder and run:


   ```bash
    npm i
  ```
3. Set the environment variables in the `example.env` file and remove the prefix `example` to use it as your `.env` file for development. In order to add the necessary Cloudinary values, create a account at the following [site](https://cloudinary.com/users/register/free). Afterwards follow the steps to create an unsigned upload preset from this [site](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/upload_images#upload_presets). For the Google API key follow this [guide](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key).

  ```bash
  REACT_APP_SERVER_BASE_URL=
  REACT_APP_CLOUDINARY_NAME=
  REACT_APP_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=
  REACT_APP_GOOGLE_API_KEY=
  ```

### To start

To start the frontend, still in the `client` folder, run:

   ```bash
    npm start
  ```
  
This will build the React app, and open it in the browser.

### To access the app

You are able to sign-up as a new user. You will then access the "Submit Profile" page, where you can enter a first and last name of your choosing. The picture is optional.

If you'd like to access the application with a pre-generated user profile, after seeding the database (please refer to the back-end repository), enter on the Sign-in page:
